b5_Mpi_vs_m2g_WilsonFermions_AllL --> Pion mass as a function of (m²g)^1/3 for several values of L. Two flavors case.
Parameters: beta = 5, Lt = 64, L = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Nf= 2, Fermions = Wilson, NMeas = 10 000, sigma = 1.

b5_20x20_GMOR --> Fpi obtained through the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation.
Parameters: beta = 5, Lt = 20, L = 20, Nf = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Fermions = Overlap, Nmeas = 10 000, sigma = 1.
