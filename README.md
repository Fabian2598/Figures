* [b5_Nf2_ResMpi_WilsonFermions.pdf](b5_Nf2_ResMpi_WilsonFermions.pdf) &rarr; Residual pion mass as a function of $L$ for the two flavors case. Results obtained with Wilson fermions. 

  **Parameters**: $\beta$ = 5, $L_t$ = 64, $N_f$ = 2, Fermions = Wilson, Nmeas = 10 000, sigma = 3.

* [b5_Mpi_vs_m2g_WilsonFermions_AllL.pdf](b5_Mpi_vs_m2g_WilsonFermions_AllL.pdf) &rarr; Pion mass as a function of $(m²g)^{1/3}$ for several values of $L$. Two flavors case.

  **Parameters**: $\beta$ = 5, $L_t$ = 64, $L$ = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, $N_f$= 2, Fermions = Wilson, NMeas = 10 000, sigma = 3.

* [b5_20x20_GMOR.pdf](b5_20x20_GMOR.pdf) &rarr; $F_\pi$ obtained through the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation.

  **Parameters**: $\beta$ = 5, $L_t$ = 20, $L$ = 20, $N_f$ =  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Fermions = Overlap, Nmeas = 30 000, sigma = 1.

* [b5_24x24_GMOR.pdf](b5_24x24_GMOR.pdf) &rarr; $F_\pi$ obtained through the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation.

  **Parameters**: $\beta$ = 5, $L_t$ = 24, $L$ = 24, $N_f$ =  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Fermions = Overlap, Nmeas = 30 000, sigma = 1.
 
* [b4_Nf2_ResMpi_overlap.pdf](b4_Nf2_ResMpi_overlap.pdf) &rarr; Residual pion mass as a function of $L$ for the two flavors case.

  **Parameters**:  $\beta$ = 4, $L_t$ = 32, $L$ = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, $N_f$ = 2, Fermions = Overlap, Nmeas = 10 000, sigma = 3. We fit the   full range  of points.

* [b4_Mpi_vs_m2g_Overlap_AllL.pdf](b4_Mpi_vs_m2g_Overlap_AllL.pdf) &rarr; Pion mass as a function of $(m²g)^{1/3}$ for several values of $L$. Two flavors case.

  **Parameters**: $\beta$ = 4, $L_t$ = 32, $L$ = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, $N_f$ = 2, Fermions = Overlap, Nmeas = 10 000, sigma = 3.

* [b4_AllNf_ResMpi_overlap.pdf](b4_AllNf_ResMpi_overlap.pdf) &rarr; Residual pion mass as a function of $L$ for several flavors. Results obtained with overlap fermions.

  For $N_f>2$ the fit is up to $L$ = 7, for $N_f=2$ we fit the full range. $F_\pi$ is computed with the "magic formula".
  
  **Parameters**: $\beta$ = 4, $L_t$ = 32, $L$ = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, $N_f$ = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Fermions = Overlap, Nmeas = 10 000, sigma   = 3. 
  
   In the following table we report the $\chi^2$/dof for the fits shown in the file [b4_AllNf_ResMpi_overlap.pdf](b4_AllNf_ResMpi_overlap.pdf)
